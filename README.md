## Development guide

**The Reporter** theme provides a first-class development experience out of the box.

### Setup

To see realtime changes during development, symlink the The Reporter theme folder to the `content/themes` folder in your local Ghost install. 

```bash
ln -s /path/to/the-reporter /ghost/content/themes/the-reporter
```

Restart Ghost and select the **The Reporter** theme from **Settings**.

From the theme's root directory, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If Node isn't installed, follow the [official Node installation guide](https://nodejs.org/).

### Start development mode

From the The Reporter theme folder, start development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Changes you make to your styles, scripts, and Handlebars files will show up automatically in the browser. CSS and Javascript will be compiled and output to the `built` folder.

Press `ctrl + c` in the terminal to exit development mode.

### Build, zip, and test your theme

Compile your CSS and JavaScript assets for production with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Create a zip archive:

```bash
npm run zip
```

Use `gscan` to test your theme for compatibility with Ghost:

```bash
npm run test
```
